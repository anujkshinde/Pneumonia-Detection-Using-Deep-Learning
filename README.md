Overview:
This project focuses on building a deep learning model to detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images. The model was developed using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow/Keras and deployed using Streamlit for real-time inference.

Key Features:
Dataset: Chest X-ray images (~5,000+) classified as "Pneumonia" or "Normal".
Preprocessing: Image resizing & normalization.
Model: CNN architecture with dropout regularization.
Deployment: Streamlit app for real-time prediction from uploaded images.
